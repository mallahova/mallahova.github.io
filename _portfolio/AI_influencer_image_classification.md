## Overview
This project focuses on developing a face recognition model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Additionally, it aims to compare the performance of Logistic Regression and CNN for image classification tasks.

## Key Components
- Developed a CNN model achieving an impressive Accuracy Score of 0.9844.
- Scraped images of 6 AI influencers from Google Images and utilized OpenCV Cascade Classifiers for face detection.
- Implemented Data Augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the CNN model.
- Explored a Machine Learning (ML) approach
  - Applied feature extraction using Wavelet transform.
  - Employed K Fold Cross Validation for model selection
  - Trained a Logistic Regression model with an accuracy score of 0.9255.
- Explored Deep Learning (DL) approach:
  - Utilized TensorFlow for data preprocessing and model building.
  - Created and deployed a [Web Application](https://ai-influencer-image-classification.streamlit.app/) for model comparison.
