## Overview:
This project focuses on three main components: Database Design and Implementation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Customer Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-means clustering.

## Tasks Completed:
1. **Designing and Implementing a Database**:
   - Created an SQL database and populated it using the Brazilian E-Commerce dataset.
   - Implemented triggers to update sequential values within the database.
   - Designed and implemented views and procedures within the database infrastructure, exported the results derived from them to CSV files.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Utilized Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations.
   - Analyzed online purchasing behaviors and relationships in the Brazilian market.
   - Unraveled the underlying trends and patterns.
   
3. **Customer Segmentation**:
     - RFM Analysis:
       - Calculated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics using SQL queries.
       - Explored the distributions of RFM metrics.
     - K-means Clustering:
       - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
       - Applied K-means clustering to RFM data.
       - Analyzed segment characteristics.
     - Visualization and conclusion
       - Interpreted results, plotted clusters and assigned meaningful names to them.
       - Summarized findings and drew conclusions from the analysis.
