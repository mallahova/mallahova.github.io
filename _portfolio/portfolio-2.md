  - Conducted **EDA** and handled null values
  - Utilized **Feature Engineering** and Ordinal Encoding
  - Applied **Z-score Normalization** for data scaling
  - Employed **K Fold Cross Validation** for model selection
  - Created and deployed a [web application](https://diamond-price-prediction-app.streamlit.app/)
